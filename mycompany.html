      <div class="block1">
        <p><img src="pictures/saffron.PNG" alt="Saffron">Empowering Afghan family farmers by bringing their saffron to international markets, and empowering their children by reinvesting in their local schools.</p>
        <p>On April 2017, Heray Spice is founded by two US Army Linguists who served the Army for 3.5 years in Afghanistan. We immigrated from Afghanistan to Chicago in December 2014. The company’s profound aim is to serve restaurants and home chefs with the natural and fresh saffron. As well as, building a better economy for Afghan farmers.</p>
        <p>Our saffron is sourced directly from family farmers in Afghanistan. The farmers of Afghanistan, under constant pressure to produce crops like Marijuana and poppy, do not have many options to make an honest living, And we are there to help them cultivate saffron instead of poppy.</p>
        <p>It costs only $70 to educate a child for a year in Afghanistan. Despite, 1 out of 5 children reach to 5th grade; the rest drop out of school in those early ages for financial reasons. 10% of our net profit is contributed to educating kids in Afghanistan. At the moment, we are in partner with three elementary schools in Herat Province of Afghanistan. Currently, we are serving 51 restaurants and grocery stores in Chicago land area, including Michelin Stars Restaurateur and Five Star hotels. We have a partnership with 18 Afghan family farmers and 3 elementary schools. The goal is to help 30 family farmers, and 6 elementary schools by March 2018.</p>

      <h2 class="s_title"> What is Saffron? </h2>
      <div class="block3">
        <p><img src="pictures/pic4.JPG" alt="Mohammad Picture"><img class="pic222" src="pictures/pic5.JPG" alt="Mohammad Picture">Saffron threads are the stigmas of the Crocus Sativus Linnaeus. Because of saffron health benefits, its price, and aromatic qualities, it is called “Queen of Spices,” and in Afghanistan, it is called, “Red Gold.” Its ethereal flavor makes a perfect enrichment for savory and sweetened plates.</p>
        <p>It takes 225,000 stigmas (or 75,000 blossoms) to make a pound of saffron. It comes from the internal of the amethyst-colored saffron crocus and must be hand-harvested due to its delicateness.</p>
